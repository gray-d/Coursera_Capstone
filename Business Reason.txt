Problem and Background:
I want to understand if the severity of a car collision can accurately be predicted by variables that represent
driving conditions and driver behavior. If a model can accurately predict car collision severity, then the model
can take estimated conditions, such as weather or amount of drunk drivers, and predict the severity of car
collisions for future situations. This will allow emergency services to plan accordingly.

Data Description:
The data set is a comma-separated values (.csv) file from the Seattle Department of Transportation.
It contains collision data from thousands of collisions that occurred in Seattle from 2004 to the present.
Each incident has an associated severity code which allows for supervised machine learning. However, the
amount of cases per severity code is quite unbalanced so that will need to be rebalanced by either upsampling
the minority cases or downsampling the majority case. To make the model, the collision type, weather, time of day,
season, driver drunkeness, and day of the week will be included in the featured data set. Most of this data is
categorical and will need 1-hot encoding or dummy values to become numerical and better suited for machine learning
models such as Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Once the most accurate model is created, it will be
available for future use to predict car collision severity.
